Topic: The-number-of-occurences

Reference: n/a

Description: 
```javascript=
Given a string A and n strings B1, B2, B3, ..., Bn, count the maximum number of occurrences
For example, if A is "50", n = 3, and the n strings are
"5005"     => 1
"055050"   => 2
"55000"    => 1
then your answer should be 2 

1. You may assume string B is always longer than string A
2. The first line of the input is the string A (0 < length of A <= 4)
3. For the next n lines, each line contains a string Bi (length of A < length of Bi < 9)
4. Output: The maximum number of occurrences of A appears in B1 to Bn
```
