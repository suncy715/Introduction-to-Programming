    let A be an array of Boolean values, indexed by integers 2 to n,
    initially all set to true.
    
    for i = 2, 3, 4, ..., not exceeding âˆšn do
        if A[i] is true
            for j = i^2, i^2+i, i^2+2i, i^2+3i, ..., not exceeding n do
                A[j] := false

    return all i such that A[i] is true.
